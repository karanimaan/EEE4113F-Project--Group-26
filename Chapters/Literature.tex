\section{Data Transmission and User Interface}
The client requires the weight data to be retrieved remotely. We need to figure out two things: where do we want the data to be sent, and how do we want it to be sent.
This section investigates different options for transmitting data from a microprocessor. In a comparative performance study by Eridani et al., three protocols were compared: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi direct, and ESP-NOW ("a new protocol that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other without the use of Wi-Fi, with low power consumption" \cite{comparitiveEspnow}). 5 metrics were used in the tests: maximum range, transmission speed, latency, power usage, and signal resistance to obstructions \cite{comparitiveEspnow}. A brief summary of the performance of each protocol is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:performance}.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:performance}
\end{figure}

ESP-NOW performs best in range and latency; Bluetooth in power usage; and Wi-Fi in transmission speed. In our context, power usage would be most important. Bluetooth seems to provide sufficient range and speed.

The problem with this; however, is that connecting the system to the user's phone requires effort and perhaps expertise that the user may not have. In this case, connecting the system to the internet may be a better option (if internet connection is available, i.e. if eduroam is in range). 

Budoyo and Andriana used the internet when designing a prototype of a digital scale to measure the weight of onions. \cite{iot}. They interfaced the microcontroller (an  ATMega2560) to the internet using an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The weight data is sent to a website where it is stored in a database.
