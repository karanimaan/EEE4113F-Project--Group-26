	ABSTRACT = {This article discusses the experiences from the development and deployment of two image-based environmental monitoring sensor applications using an embedded wireless sensor network. Our system uses low-power image sensors and the Tenet general purpose sensing system for tiered embedded wireless sensor networks. It leverages Tenet’s built-in support for reliable delivery of high rate sensing data, scalability and its flexible scripting language, which enables mote-side image compression and the ease of deployment. Our first deployment of a pitfall trap monitoring application at the James San Jacinto Mountain Reserve provided us with insights and lessons learned into the deployment of and compression schemes for these embedded wireless imaging systems. Our three month-long deployment of a bird nest monitoring application resulted in over 100,000 images collected from a 19-camera node network deployed over an area of 0.05 square miles, despite highly variable environmental conditions. Our biologists found the on-line, near-real-time access to images to be useful for obtaining data on answering their biological questions.},

	pages={312-317},
	abstract={Energy Harvesting (EH) is a mature solution to extend the short lifetime of many wireless sensor nodes and IoT devices. However, miniaturizing EH devices to supply low power and small form factor IoT devices is still challenging and not always effective. In fact, EH from the miniaturized is more challenging due to strict constraints in terms of size, weight, and cost. Among other technologies, wireless power transmission is growing of popularity due to the fact that it can be controlled and it is less unpredictable than environments sources. This paper presents a review of technologies for wireless power transmission that can supply cm-scale low power IoT devices. Additionally, this paper provides in-field evaluation with mm-scale antennas of radio frequency power transmission using a commercial system: Powercast. Experimental results focus on evaluating the power flowing in the battery, which also includes the conversion losses, for different distances and antennas. Infield evaluation shows that it is possible to achieve mW of usable power to one meter and hundreds of μW at few meters. Those powers are enough for a wide range of low power and miniaturized IoT devices and IoT applications. In conclusion, this paper shows that RF transmission is an effective and alternative way to supply perpetually low power IoT devices.},
